## Security Scores

| Category | Score | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Basic Security Checks | 5/7 (71%) |  WARNING |
| Code Quality | 0/2 (0%) |  WARNING |
| Vulnerability Scanning | 4/10 (40%) |   FAIL |
| Deployment Status | 1/1 (100%) |   PASS |

## Tool Results
- Rustfmt:   Failed
- Clippy:   Failed

## Basic Security Checks

| Check | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Checked Math Operations |   Implemented | Contract uses checked math operations to prevent overflows/underflows |
| Authority Validation |   Not found | Authority validation may be missing! This may allow unauthorized access to funds or operations |
| Registry Integration |   Implemented | Contract integrates with the Registry service |
| Error Handling |   Implemented | Contract implements custom error handling |
| PDA Bump Handling |   Implemented | Contract uses proper bump handling for PDAs |
| Re-entrancy Protection |   Not found | No explicit re-entrancy protection found! Verify that contract is not vulnerable to re-entrancy attacks |
| Integer Overflow Protection |   Implemented | Contract has integer overflow/underflow protection |

## Vulnerability Scanning Results

### Found 6 Potential Vulnerabilities:

| Vulnerability | Risk | Description | Recommendation |
|---------------|------|-------------|----------------|
| Arbitrary CPI Calls | MEDIUM | Program makes direct CPI calls which need scrutiny | Ensure CPI calls are properly validated and authorized |
| Potential Reentrancy | HIGH | External calls followed by state changes may lead to reentrancy | Implement a reentrancy guard or ensure state changes happen before external calls |
| Unsafe Math | HIGH | Unchecked arithmetic operations may lead to overflows/underflows | Use checked_ variants for all arithmetic operations |
| Hardcoded Seeds | LOW | Hardcoded seeds in PDAs require careful review | Ensure seeds are appropriate and follow security best practices |
| Unprotected State Modification | MEDIUM | Function lacks explicit access controls | Add appropriate access control using constraints or requires! macros |
| Missing Close Functionality | MEDIUM | Accounts can be initialized but not closed, leading to resource waste | Implement close functionality for all initializable accounts |

## Deployment Status
- Contract is deployed on devnet

## Recommendations
- 🔑 **Basic Security**: Implement Authority Validation: Authority validation may be missing! This may allow unauthorized access to funds or operations
- 🔑 **Basic Security**: Implement Re-entrancy Protection: No explicit re-entrancy protection found! Verify that contract is not vulnerable to re-entrancy attacks
- 📏 **Code Quality**: Fix code formatting issues by running `cargo fmt`
- 🔍 **Code Quality**: Address clippy warnings to improve code quality
- 🛡️ **Security Vulnerability**: Fix Arbitrary CPI Calls (MEDIUM risk): Ensure CPI calls are properly validated and authorized
- 🛡️ **Security Vulnerability**: Fix Potential Reentrancy (HIGH risk): Implement a reentrancy guard or ensure state changes happen before external calls
- 🛡️ **Security Vulnerability**: Fix Unsafe Math (HIGH risk): Use checked_ variants for all arithmetic operations
- 🛡️ **Security Vulnerability**: Fix Hardcoded Seeds (LOW risk): Ensure seeds are appropriate and follow security best practices
- 🛡️ **Security Vulnerability**: Fix Unprotected State Modification (MEDIUM risk): Add appropriate access control using constraints or requires! macros
- 🛡️ **Security Vulnerability**: Fix Missing Close Functionality (MEDIUM risk): Implement close functionality for all initializable accounts

## Next Steps
1. Address all recommendations listed above
2. Run the security analysis again after implementing fixes
3. Consider professional security audit before mainnet deployment
4. Monitor for new security vulnerabilities in similar contracts
